		title: 'Knowledge Ecosystems',
		description: 'We examine how knowledge ecosystems exist today, develop playbooks for how to improve them, and facilitate new knowledge life cycles accelerated through multi-institution collaboration.',
		long description: 'We need inclusive, multi-institutional collaboration that centers the diversity of knowledge creators and fields of inquiry as a strength. With much of the world’s knowledge currently locked behind paywalls and the gates of large corporations, existing knowledge ecosystems are broken and serve financial incentives, not those that favor the public good. Through this program, we will create new, healthier life cycles for discovering and communicating knowledge. That means we'll explore the strengths and weaknesses of existing systems, their bottlenecks and biases, and then prototype and create models that move us towards growing, resilient knowledge ecosystems. To start, we ask, who is the future for and what tools do we need to build it? We will convene organizations with a broad range of expertise to conduct that research, host conversations with diverse and interdisciplinary communities, build open tools, and create playbooks so others can implement, and further develop themselves, healthier knowledge ecosystems.'

		title: 'Community Publishing',
		description: 'We build infrastructure that enables community-driven publishing and more thorough, trustworthy, and inclusive models for publishing platforms and tools.',
		long description: 'The knowledge created by individuals is often grounded in a community that informs and supports their work -- we need tools that better reflect this community-centric process. In order to do that, we can learn from models of publishing in academia, law, journalism, and provide a useful infrastructure for more efficient collaboration. These new publishing models are rapidly being adopted by institutions and groups that encapsulate a diverse set of perspectives, and through the work of this program, we are finding that the desire for access to knowledge is stronger than the commercial and artificial constraints imposed to prevent knowledge from being shared widely. To start, we ask, how can we improve on current publishing systems and increase access to knowledge in the future? We build the community-driven publishing infrastructure and contribute to a culture that celebrates those efforts.'

		title: 'Universal Data',
		description: 'We research and develop tools for discovery, provenance, and interoperability of data, in service of ensuring transparent and universal access to public knowledge.',
		long description: 'Data about the world, compiled by and received from others, is an anchor for many analyses, beliefs, and understandings of ourselves and the world around us. Carefully compiled and placed in context, this is a powerful way to extend our knowledge beyond personal experience. It is also easy to lie with data; it is only as useful as its context. We are exploring ways to contextualize, share, and connect data to other sources. We must also broaden our understanding of the biases in current models for data gathering, compilation, and the assignment of trust. Universal access to data requires services and interfaces for sense-making and visualization that let people determine what sources to trust in a given context. Through this program, we will explore the spaces between current data ecosystems, implement more equitable approaches to data sharing, and build tools, interfaces, and protocols for connecting the world’s knowledge. To start, we ask, how can we make data more publicly accessible and access universal? We will build the tools needed to get those answers.'

		title: 'Measuring Knowledge',
		description: 'We craft new knowledge analytics that match the growth, learning, and empowerment afforded by modern knowledge systems to redefine impact and success.',
		long description: 'There is growing support for initiatives that establish more representative knowledge analytics in scholarly publishing. Current metrics are optimized to sell access to scholarly work and that’s fundamentally ill-suited for the demands of research. To meet this demand we must critically assess how we measure impact and make visible the incentive structures currently operating that encourage what analytics we track and value. Considering existing publishing structures while imagining new ones, we can grapple with the reality that what we measure can impact what’s studied and valued. The data points we measure should serve as guideposts for future research and inform next steps. Through this program, we will explore what and how data should be collected in order to improve the work of researchers, the support offered by publishers, and the understanding of readers. To start, we ask, what information would help researchers build upon work already completed to inform further progress and understanding? We will work with partners to understand those metrics and build tools to collect them.'
